# Chanrithisak Phok (Cal) - Personal Website

**An original creation by Chanrithisak Phok**  
A retro Windows 95-inspired personal portfolio website, entirely conceived, designed, and built from scratch by me — Chanrithisak Phok.

This site is my personal take on the classic Windows 95 experience, mixing nostalgia with modern interactivity — all crafted with care and creativity.
